# antweb-to-postgreSQL
Converts a csv retrieved from antweb.org into data that can be used in a PostgreSQL database.

You can change the fields in navicat_specimen_fields, navicat_collection_fields, and navicat_specimen_fields to the fields in your
database and the program will associate the antweb fields with these fields. Dates are changed to iso format.
